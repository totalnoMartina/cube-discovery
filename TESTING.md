## Bugs

For user to input the name, I tried using Python [prompt_toolkit](https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/master/) and heroku did not seem to recognize, so I removed that.
Some infinite loops are caused and that was handled with exiting function.

original validation was discovered through these bugs
