## Bugs

### Solved bugs

Double function cube showed up as a bug during creating this test, and dicovered after testing that it just stayed uncommented like a few other functions, and got resolved after testing.

Trying using isalpha() as a function does not suit in taking input without spaces, and this concept, so it took some time to accept and apply another simple solution instead. I mostly focused on empty space being entered and validated with appropriate message for the user at all occasions.

At the welcome, the input that takes the name of the user could be more detailed in explanation(example: multiple names), and I wanted to note that user should write in one word. I wanted only normal letters and one word to be accepted and obvious to the user.

### Unresolved bugs

This application is created using Chromebook based on Chromium (Linux) and sometimes it would freeze, not sure is it because of machine, or the app, or the fact that the changes are recorded by Heroku and that could make it freeze. Refreshing resolves this issue.

## Validator - PEP8

Validating through PEP8 online website, and no issues were presented

### Validation testing Notes

Please Note - accepting all characters in user_answer_inputs ('user_anwer_first/second/third/fourth/fifth') is planned for this app.
Details below:
During testing the function cube() for validation of the user input being symbols/characters as '#;08=-' or space character, a method .isalpha() was tested many times, which is also spacebar-sensitive, and will not take user input if entered space in between. The method is taken out of the function because of user possibly wanting to describe in long sentences with a comma or space and possibly exclamation marks or similar. Therefore, the function prints out exact input of user with the symbols included, if any. 
By putting this method I might have had limited user to describe everything in one go and made it more complicated. So this was my reason to not use validation for isalpha() and accept symbols as user input and only respond to user once the empty space is entered.

Another option considered was creating a list from user input, splitting by space, adding inputs into a list, separating by a comma/space (again, something that would complicate function further), and then later using a `for` loop to place them back as user wrote them or a common method in Python called tostring(). In my perspective, this validation is only relevant if user slips a finger without writing anything in, so we bring user back to the beginning to write the description again, with apropriate prompt message. And if user wants to put commas/spaces, I wanted that to be allowed.

While infinite loops are caused, that was handled with an exiting function, and some are changed to conditional as it did not suit - like for welcome. I did not want the application to keep being in a loop, so I made an option to stop the function for user. I find it could be annoying if it keeps insisting on users to try again. There is 'Run Program' to direct user after playing if he wants to start again so it is on user to decide. 
I realize we live in times when we create needs for users and satisfy them by creating products, and repetative asking is popular to use in creating applications. However, this application is quite personal and requires some more attention and brain activity to have a 'self-check', I thought that would already be hard for user, mentally/emotionally, so I did not want to keep asking to play again as that could cause a less positive experience. 

For iterating from one object to another, I had an idea to use separate function called next_or_restart() which was used before the functions were ready to connect to each other. As the app evolved, the function is no longer needed and therefore, deleted.
At the bottom of this [image](https://github.com/totalnoMartina/cube-discovery/blob/main/documentation/readme-images/ladder.png) you can see user being asked to go 'Next or Restart'.

The testing of app in the start was done by creating a function called all_funcs() that had smaller functions for me to test and manipulate. It was deleted after the application was ready, as it was no longer needed.

* I want the User to have fun, get personal and have a positive experience

## Further Testing

One idea was to keep user input as global variables at the start, than use later in a function where interpretation is displayed, so they come up together. That noted, function `clear()` would clear up space in the terminal for the visual space and possibly remove the inputs as nothing existed, so therefore I did not implement this idea in this application. When tried, it kept returning that no variable to store input was declared, even I had the keyword present and a function returning the value of input.
