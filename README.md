# Caveats 
- reasons why app is not usable in real world, but i think it is... we'll see :)

# Acknowledgements

Code Institute mentor, Tim Nelson is huge help and guidance, helping me and directing my ideas toward real goal to be accomplished through creating this app. I was unsure on how to start and I had perfect guidance.
My close friends who tested the app a few times, shared insights and concerns that help me make this better for the UX.






Welcome Martina Grganic,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **August 17, 2021**

## Reminders

* Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
* Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
* Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line. --- what does this mean??? ask tim

Happy coding!
